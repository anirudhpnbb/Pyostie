In Medicare assigned orCHAMPUS participation cases, the physician agrees to accept the charge determination of the Medicare carrier or CHAMPUS fiscal intermediary as the full charge,and the patient is responsible only for the deductible, coinsurance and noncovered services.

It is also used to decide if the servicesand supplies you received are covered by these programs and to insure that proper payment is made.The information may also be given to other providers of services, carriers, intermediaries, medical review boards, health plans, and other organizations or Federalagencies, for the effective administration of Federal provisions that require other third parties payers to pay primary to Federal program, and as otherwise necessaryto administer these programs. For example, it may be necessary to disclose information about the benefits you have used to a hospital or doctor.

With the one exception discussedbelow, there are no penalties under these programs for refusing to supply information. However, failure to furnish information regarding the medical services renderedor the amount charged would prevent payment of claims under these programs. Failure to furnish any other information, such as name or claim number, would delaypayment of the claim.
